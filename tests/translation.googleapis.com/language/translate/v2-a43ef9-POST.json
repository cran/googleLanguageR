Nielsen Jul 11th. 2017 at 08.30 Mail Twitter Facebook There are a few words spoken to Apple from the otherwise critical Greenpeace environmental organization after the US company has announced plans to build a data center in Kassø at Aabenraa. Apple has announced that it is a long way in investing in one to two wind farms in Denmark to cover the company&#39;s energy needs in the two Danish data centers in Aabenraa and Viborg. Even though no mention has yet been made of the Danish partner who is going to construct the wind farm or parks, the message is not unnoticed by Greenpeace. &quot;It is crucial that Apple apparently already has projects on the drawing board, where one will actually stand behind the construction of new wind power that can cover the electricity consumption of the two data centers with green power. If the company only ate of the total green energy in Denmark, the bill would end up with Danish consumers, and not least the climate, says Greenpeace Denmark, Mads Flarup Christensen, in a written comment on DR News.

Facebook confirmed earlier this year that it will settle down with a 56,500 square meter data center in Odense. Here too, the power comes from renewable energy, but Facebook has still not told whether the power should come from newly built renewable energy, or whether you want to purchase green certificates and thus consume of Denmark&#39;s current stock of green energy production. Without new investments, the share of green energy drops If Facebook does not invest in new renewable energy, it will mean that the total share of green energy in the Danish energy network will be lower. Energinet.dk, which runs the Danish electricity grid, has previously told Ingeniøren that three new data centers will increase consumption by 3.8 TWh in 2022. There is no less than 11 percent of Danish electricity consumption in 2015. This figure is without a Any Google data center currently speculated. Google has confirmed that you have purchased a land in Fredericia, but if there is a data center on it is too early to say.
