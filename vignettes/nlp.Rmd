The Google Natural Language API reveals the structure and meaning of text by offering powerful machine learning models in an easy to use REST API. You can use it to extract information about people, places, events and much more, mentioned in text documents, news articles or blog posts. You can also use it to understand sentiment about your product on social media or parse intent from customer conversations happening in a call center or a messaging app.

The Natural Language API returns natural language understanding technologies.  You can call them individually, or the default is to return them all.  The available returns are:

* *Entity analysis* - Finds named entities (currently proper names and common nouns) in the text along with entity types, salience, mentions for each entity, and other properties.  If possible, will also return metadata about that entity such as a Wikipedia URL. If using the **v1beta2** endpoint this also includes sentiment for each entity.
* *Syntax* - Analyzes the syntax of the text and provides sentence boundaries and tokenization along with part of speech tags, dependency trees, and other properties.
* *Sentiment* - The overall sentiment of the text, represented by a magnitude `[0, +inf]` and score between `-1.0` (negative sentiment) and `1.0` (positive sentiment).


### Demo for Entity Analysis

You can pass a vector of text which will call the API for each element.  The return is a list of responses, each response being a list of tibbles holding the different types of analysis.

```r
library(googleLanguageR)

texts <- c("to administer medicince to animals is frequently a very difficult matter,
         and yet sometimes it's necessary to do so", 
         "I don't know how to make a text demo that is sensible")
nlp_result <- gl_nlp(texts)
```

Each text has its own entry in returned tibbles

```r
str(nlp_result, max.level = 2)
#List of 6
# $ sentences        :List of 2
#  ..$ :'data.frame':	1 obs. of  4 variables:

# $ documentSentiment:Classes ‘tbl_df’, ‘tbl’ and 'data.frame':	2 obs. of  2 variables:
#  ..$ magnitude: num [1:2] 0.5 0.3
#  ..$ score    : num [1:2] 0.5 -0.3
```

Sentence structure and sentiment:

```r
## sentences structure
nlp_result$sentences[[2]]
#                                                content beginOffset magnitude score
#1 I don't know how to make a text demo that is sensible           0       0.3  -0.3
```

Information on what words (tokens) are within each text:

```r
# word tokens data
str(nlp_result$tokens[[1]])
#'data.frame':	6 obs. of  17 variables:
# $ content       : chr  "to" "administer" "medicince" "to" ...

```

What entities within text have been identified, with optional wikipedia URL if its available.

```r
nlp_result$entities
#[[1]]

The language for the text:

```r
nlp_result$language
# [1] "en" "en"
```

The original passed in text, to aid with working with the output:

```r
nlp_result$text
# [1] "to administer medicince to animals is frequently a very difficult matter,\n         and yet sometimes  it's necessary to do so"
# [2] "I don't know how to make a text demo that is sensible"
